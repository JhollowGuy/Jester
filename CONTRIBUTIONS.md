## Contributing to Jester
Welcome, and thanks for wanting to help out with Jester â€” a game framework made with pure Java for beginners!
Here are a few simple rules to follow when contributing.

---

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo** and make changes in your fork.
2. Create a new branch with a clear name like `fix-input-bug` or `add-something`.
3. Submit a **Pull Request** (PR) with a description of what you changed and why.
4. Keep your code beginner-friendly. Avoid overcomplicating things.
5. Try to follow the file structure and style used in the rest of the project.

## Design Principles

- **Beginner-friendly always.**
    - If it's confusing for a beginner, it doesn't belong here.
- **Modular and simple.**
    - Each file should do one clear thing (e.g. `JesterAudio.java`, `JesterInput.java`).
- **Readable over clever.**
    - Easy-to-understand code > fancy one-liners.
- **No external dependencies** unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Before You Submit

- Make sure your code compiles and works.
- Add comments if your code introduces something new or tricky.
- If possible, include a tiny example or usage in a test/game file.

---

## Please Avoid

- Adding complex features with no clear beginner use-case.
- Adding unnecessary dependencies or libraries.
- Breaking existing code or changing APIs without a reason.
