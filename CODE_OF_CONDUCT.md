# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the **Jester Framework** community!

To keep this a safe, friendly place for everyone (especially beginners), we ask all contributors to follow this simple code of conduct.

---

## 👏 Be Respectful

- Be kind and patient.
- Don’t be rude, dismissive, or mean — especially to beginners.
- Everyone’s learning. No question is too “dumb.”

---

## 🤝 Help Out
- If someone asks a question, try to help them.
- If you see something confusing, suggest how to make it easier.
- If someone makes a mistake in their code or pull request, kindly explain.

---

## 🚫 Not Allowed
- No hate speech, harassment, or discrimination of any kind.
- No bullying, trolling, or toxic behavior.
- No spamming, self-promotion, or irrelevant content.


---

## 💬 When in Doubt

Ask nicely in Issues or start a discussion.  
We’re here to learn and grow — together.

---

## 🙌 Enforcement

Anyone who breaks these rules may be warned, banned, or blocked depending on the situation.  
Let’s keep Jester a welcoming place for all.

Thanks for being a part of this journey! 🎮
